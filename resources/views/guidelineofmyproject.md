# Project Planning and Requirements Analysis
Goal: Understand the app's objectives and gather functional and non-functional requirements.

1. Define Objectives:
Track attendance for church members and visitors.
Provide weekly or monthly attendance reports.
Allow admins to manage events and view analytics.
Identify Key Features:

2. User Registration/Login
Event/Service Management
Attendance Tracking (with options like QR code scanning or manual check-in)
Notifications/Reminders for services or special events

## Admin Dashboard for managing users, events, and viewing reports
Determine User Roles:
1. Admin: Manages events, views attendance analytics, and has access to all reports.
2. Member/User: Can check in to events and view their own attendance history.

## Set Non-functional Requirements:
1. Performance: Ensure the app runs smoothly and quickly.
2. Security: Implement authentication, authorization, and secure data handling.
3. Usability: Make the interface intuitive and user-friendly.
4. Scalability: Consider future expansion (e.g., adding more features or supporting a larger number of users).


## System Architecture and Technology Stack
Goal: Plan the app's architecture and select appropriate tools and technologies.

1. Architecture:
    1. Frontend: Mobile app (React Native for cross-platform, Flutter, or native Android/iOS development). 1.1
    2. Backend: RESTful API using Node.js, Python (Django or Flask), or .NET. 1.2
    3. Database: Relational (e.g., MySQL/PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) depending on scalability needs. 1.3
    4. Authentication: Use secure methods like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication. 1.4

## UI/UX Design
### Goal: Create a user-friendly, visually appealing design.

#### Wireframes and Prototypes:
  1. Sketch out screens for registration/login, attendance tracking, event management, and admin dashboard.
  2. Use tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD to design wireframes and interactive prototypes.

#### App Screens:
   1. Login/Registration Screen: Allow members to sign up or log in.
   2. Home Screen: Overview of upcoming services/events and access to attendance history.
   3. Event Check-In Screen: QR code scanner or manual check-in button.
   4. Admin Dashboard: Displays event details, attendance numbers, and reports.
   5. Settings/Profile Screen: For updating profile info and preferences.

#### Design Principles:
   1. Keep the interface clean and intuitive.
   2. Ensure the text is readable and buttons are easily accessible.
   3. Use church colors or branding for a familiar feel.

   # Frontend Development
## Goal: Develop the mobile or web interface that users will interact with.
### Registration/Login:
1. Integrate authentication with the backend API.
2. Provide form validation for accurate data input.
### Event Listing and Details:
1. Display upcoming events on the home screen.
2. Include details of each event, such as time, location, and attendance options.
### Attendance Check-In:
1. Allow users to check in via QR code or manual check-in options.
2. Confirm successful check-in with a message or notification.
### Admin Dashboard:
1. Build views for managing users, events, and attendance data.
2. Provide easy access to analytics and report downloads.

# Backend Development
## Goal: Build the backend that will handle data storage, user management, and attendance tracking.
### User Management:
1. Set up endpoints for user registration, login, and authentication (e.g., JWT).
2. Allow users to update their profile information and view their attendance history.
### Event Management:
1. Create endpoints to add, update, and delete events.
2. Each event should have fields like title, date, location, and organizer.
### Attendance Tracking:
1. Implement check-in and check-out endpoints.
2. Consider QR code generation for each event to streamline attendance tracking.
### Reporting:
1. Build endpoints for generating attendance reports, e.g., weekly or monthly summaries.
1. Ensure that only admins can access sensitive reports.

# Notifications and Reminders
## Goal: Set up push notifications to remind users of events or updates.
### Push Notifications:
1. Send notifications for upcoming services/events or special announcements.
2. Consider Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for implementing push notifications.
### Event Reminders:
1. Allow users to set reminders for specific events.
2. Include the option for SMS reminders for those who may not use smartphones.

# Testing and Quality Assurance
## Goal: Ensure the app is fully functional, secure, and user-friendly.
### Unit Testing: Test individual components like user authentication, event management, and attendance tracking.
### Integration Testing: Test interactions between components (e.g., checking in to an event and updating attendance records).
### User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Involve a few church members or staff to test the app and provide feedback.
### Security Testing: Test for vulnerabilities, especially around authentication and data storage.

# Deployment
## Goal: Launch the app for church members to use.

### Backend Deployment:
1. Deploy the backend to a cloud service (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or Firebase).
2. Ensure database setup and API endpoints are functioning as expected.
3. App Store Deployment (if mobile):


### Web Version (Optional):
1. If building a web app, deploy to a service like Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase Hosting.

# Maintenance and Future Enhancements
## Goal: Keep the app running smoothly and consider features to add in the future.
1. Bug Fixes: Set up a schedule to regularly check for bugs and resolve issues.
2. Feature Expansion: Collect feedback from users and consider additional features, such as more detailed analytics or member engagement tools.
3. Security Updates: Regularly update dependencies and patch any security vulnerabilities.
